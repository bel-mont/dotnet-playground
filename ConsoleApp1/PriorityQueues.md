### Natural Order and Comparer

In the natural order (ascending order), the `CompareTo` method works as follows:
- **`x.CompareTo(y)`**:
    - If `x` is less than `y`, it returns `-1`.
    - If `x` is equal to `y`, it returns `0`.
    - If `x` is greater than `y`, it returns `1`.

In the context of a priority queue:
- **`-1` (negative)**: `x` should come before `y`.
- **`0` (zero)**: The order of `x` and `y` does not change.
- **`1` (positive)**: `x` should come after `y`.

### Custom Comparer for Max Heap

To create a max heap, you need to reverse the natural order of comparison. This can be achieved by swapping `x` and `y` in the comparison:

- **`y.CompareTo(x)`**:
    - If `y` is greater than `x`, it returns `1` (which means `x` should come before `y` in the heap).
    - If `y` is equal to `x`, it returns `0`.
    - If `y` is less than `x`, it returns `-1` (which means `x` should come after `y` in the heap).

### Comparison Outcomes

- **`-1`**: The item being compared should come before the other item.
- **`0`**: The order of the items does not change.
- **`1`**: The item being compared should come after the other item.

### Example for Clarity

Let's say we are comparing `2` and `3`:
- **Using `x.CompareTo(y)`**:
    - `2.CompareTo(3)` returns `-1` (2 should come before 3 in a min heap).
    - `3.CompareTo(2)` returns `1` (3 should come after 2 in a min heap).

- **Using `y.CompareTo(x)`**:
    - `3.CompareTo(2)` returns `1` (2 should come before 3 in a max heap).
    - `2.CompareTo(3)` returns `-1` (3 should come after 2 in a max heap).

### Summary

- **Natural Order (Ascending)**:
    - `x.CompareTo(y)`: Creates a min heap (smallest element has highest priority).

- **Reversed Order (Descending)**:
    - `y.CompareTo(x)`: Creates a max heap (largest element has highest priority).
